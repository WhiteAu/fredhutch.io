title: Getting started with R
---


Definitely use R if your data is in tabular format and you want to learn from it.
R is a fantastic tool to munge, summarize, extract, plot, statistically analyze, and otherwise learn from your data.
Another great feature of R is [CRAN](http://cran.us.r-project.org), the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
CRAN is sort of like Galaxy's tool sheds, and is one of the first places to look if you want to see if a well-developed solution to your problem already exists.
Here's a poignant anecdote I like from Martin Morgan, about one of his first experiences with R:

> Iâ€™d initially written a C program that was literally thousands of lines of code. After a while, I decided to try programming in R; since the facilities for data input and optimization were already there, I was able to do it in just six lines of R code.

If you haven't used R before and are new to programming, a good place to start is the [Codeschool R starter course](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).
If you are an experienced programmer but want an overview of the language, you can't do better than the [R intro](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html) that comes with R itself.
Also, [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) is developed by Martin Morgan and his core of programmers here at the FHCRC, so there are lots of knowledgeable folks around.

Other handy R sites include the [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) site and the [list of resources compiled by RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/help_with_r).
Hadley Wickham is putting together a great-looking [Advanced R book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), including a list of what he views as essential R [vocabulary](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html).
Check out [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), even if you are fanatical about your text editor.

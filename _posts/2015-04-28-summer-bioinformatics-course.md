There is an art to Bioinformatics.
Making meaning out of raw data requires knowledge not only of individual tools and techniques, but also how they weave together.
While educational resources on specific tools and techniques are plentiful, obtaining this big picture overview can be challenging.

To help you make your way through this landscape, we will be offering a series of introductory classes on Bioinformatics.
The goal of this series is to convey the big picture of how to approach Bioinformatics, while beginning to familiarize attendees with the specific skills associated with the subject.
No course this short could possibly hope to make an expert of someone.
But with motivation, this class will provide the building blocks needed to begin learning the subject independently as you apply these techniques towards your problem domain.

The course will consist of seven one-hour classes:

1. Overview & remote server access
2. Unix Shell I - overview
3. Unix Shell II - learning specific utilities
4. Version Control with Git
5. Python I - syntax and data types
6. Python II - building data structures
7. Python III - writing a program

The curriculum will be drawn from an early release of [Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do), which will be available throughout the class free of cost.
Students will be encouraged to do a couple hours of reading and/or homework between sessions, but this will not be required.
Additionally, depending on interest, at the end of course students may pick a project to work on, and consult with the instructor for advice.
